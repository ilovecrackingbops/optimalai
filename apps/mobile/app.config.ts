 * research documents' working codename `Tally`; renamed again to `Optimal AI`
 * once the app grew past food logging into exercise, sleep, and body tracking.

 * name: the bundle identifier is what ties this build to its existing
 * TestFlight/App Store Connect record, its HealthKit entitlement, and every
 * install already on a device. Changing it would make Apple treat this as a
